            The installation centers around a radio play-like audio piece which tells a fictional story—through dialogue, 
            pop songs, sound effects, soundscapes, and found audio—of pop singer Patti Page encountering other Patti Pages as 
            she travels around the Midwest. In 1948, Patti Page became the first person to layer their own vocals on a record 
            with the release of her romantic duet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O04VcM_RY8g">“Confess.”</a>
