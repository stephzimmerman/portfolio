          <em>Career Fair</em> is an installation of multiple attempts to decode my professional resume by translating it into a variety of new forms—a score for a woodwind trio, 
          a blueprint for modernist furniture, a recipe, a map, a book of erasure poetry, a zoological index, and more.</p>

        Front Desk<br>
        Wood, steel, paint, paper<br>
        Parts [6]: Desk [29” x 65.5” x 37.5”], business cards [2” x 3.5”], pamphlet [11” x 8.5”], 
        hanging logo [21.5” x 72”], framed résumé [11” x 8.5”], infographic [11” x 8.5”]<br>
        <br>
        The shape of the desk in Front Desk was derived from the arrangement of 
        text boxes in my résumé, combined into a single form. On the wall directly 
        behind the desk are two pieces: the right piece is a copy of my original 
        résumé with the text box shapes outlined in black, while the left piece is 
        an infographic illustrating how the text box arrangement was used to fabricate the desk.The logo hanging 
        above the desk was created by layering all the words from my résumé. The text on 
        the business cards comes from the contact information on my existing business card. 
        The poetic phrases in the pamphlet were composed using select words from my original résumé.
        During the opening of Career Fair at the Des Lee Gallery in St. Louis, MO, I networked with 
        visitors, sharing an overview of my qualifications and handing out business cards.
